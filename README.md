## Project Motivation:
Credit card companies need to assess whether a customer is creditworthy before approving a credit card application. Automating this process using machine learning can save time and reduce human error. This project aims to build a predictive model that can accurately determine the approval status of credit card applications based on applicant information.

## Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is the "Credit Card Approval" dataset, which contains various features about the applicants, such as age, income, employment status, and existing credit histor,
